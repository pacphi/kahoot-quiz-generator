## Introduction

Welcome to the Kahoot Quiz Generator! This application helps educators, trainers, and quiz creators create engaging multiple-choice quizzes for [Kahoot](https://kahoot.com/). The application offers two powerful modes:

1. **ü§ñ AI Generation**: Automatically generate quiz questions using AI based on any topic
2. **üìÑ CSV Upload**: Convert your existing questions from CSV format into Kahoot-ready quizzes

Both modes produce ready-to-upload Excel files that conform to Kahoot's official quiz template format.

## Who Is This For?

- Educators creating classroom quizzes
- Corporate trainers developing training assessments
- Content creators building engaging educational content
- Anyone with existing quiz questions who wants to convert them to Kahoot format
- Anyone who wants to quickly create Kahoot quizzes without manual formatting

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the application, you'll need:

1. Access to the running application (see [RUN.md](RUN.md) for setup instructions)
2. A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
3. A Kahoot account to upload your generated quiz (free accounts available at [kahoot.com](https://kahoot.com/))

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Access the Application

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```url
http://localhost:8080
```

You should see the Kahoot Quiz Generator with two tabs at the top:

- **AI Generation** - Generate questions from a topic using AI
- **CSV Upload** - Convert your existing CSV quiz file to Kahoot format

Choose the mode that fits your needs and follow the instructions below.

---

## Mode 1: AI Generation

Use this mode when you want the AI to create quiz questions for you based on a topic.

### Step 1: Enter Your Quiz Topic

In the **Quiz Topic** field, provide a clear description or essential keywords for your quiz. The AI will use this to generate relevant questions.

**Examples of good topics:**

- "Solar System and planets"
- "World War II major events and battles"
- "JavaScript ES6 features and syntax"
- "Human anatomy - cardiovascular system"
- "Basic algebra equations and problem solving"

**Tips for effective topics:**

- Be specific rather than generic (e.g., "Photosynthesis in plants" vs. "Science")
- Include key concepts you want covered
- Use descriptive phrases rather than single words
- Mention the difficulty level if needed (e.g., "Introduction to Python for beginners")

### Step 2: Choose Number of Questions

Select how many questions you want (between 1 and 20).

**Recommended question counts:**

- **Quick review**: 5-10 questions
- **Standard quiz**: 10-15 questions
- **Comprehensive assessment**: 15-20 questions

### Step 3: Generate Your Quiz

Click the **Generate Quiz** button. The application will:

1. Send your topic to the AI
2. Generate unique questions with 4 multiple-choice answers each
3. Create an Excel file formatted for Kahoot
4. Automatically download the file to your computer

The file will be named `kahoot-quiz.xlsx`.

---

## Mode 2: CSV Upload

Use this mode when you already have quiz questions in a spreadsheet or CSV file.

### Step 1: Prepare Your CSV File

Your CSV file must include the following columns (column names are case-insensitive):

**Required Columns:**

- **Question** (or "q", "question_text") - The question text
- **Option 1** (or "option1", "answer 1", "choice 1", "a") - First answer choice
- **Option 2** (or "option2", "answer 2", "choice 2", "b") - Second answer choice
- **Option 3** (or "option3", "answer 3", "choice 3", "c") - Third answer choice
- **Option 4** (or "option4", "answer 4", "choice 4", "d") - Fourth answer choice
- **Correct Answer** (or "correct", "answer", "solution") - The text of the correct answer (must exactly match one of the four options)

**Optional Column:**

- **Time Limit** (or "time", "seconds", "duration") - Time limit in seconds (5-240). If not provided, defaults to 20 seconds.

**Example CSV Format:**

```csv
Question,Option 1,Option 2,Option 3,Option 4,Correct Answer,Time Limit
What is 2+2?,3,4,5,6,4,20
What is the capital of France?,London,Paris,Berlin,Madrid,Paris,30
Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?,Charles Dickens,William Shakespeare,Jane Austen,Mark Twain,William Shakespeare,25
```

**Important CSV Requirements:**

- Maximum 100 questions per file
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- File must have `.csv` extension
- Correct answer must **exactly match** one of the four options (case-sensitive)
- All questions must have exactly 4 answer options
- No empty questions or answer options

### Step 2: Upload Your CSV File

1. Click the **"Choose File"** or **"Browse"** button
2. Select your CSV file from your computer
3. Click the **"Upload CSV"** button

The application will parse your CSV file, detect column names, validate all questions and answers, and display a preview with any errors highlighted.

### Step 3: Review the Preview

After uploading, you'll see a table preview of your questions. The preview shows:

- ‚úÖ Green indicators for valid questions
- ‚ùå Red highlighting for rows with errors
- üìä Summary statistics (e.g., "18 of 20 questions valid")
- üìù Detailed error messages explaining what needs to be fixed

**Common Validation Errors:**

- "Correct answer must exactly match one of the four options" - Check spelling and capitalization
- "Option X is empty" - One or more answer choices are missing
- "Time limit must be between 5 and 240 seconds" - Invalid time limit value
- "Question text is empty" - Missing question text

If there are errors, fix your CSV file and upload it again.

### Step 4: Configure Conversion Options

Once your CSV is valid (no errors), you'll see conversion options:

**Available Options:**

- **‚òëÔ∏è Shuffle question order** (default: enabled)
  - Randomizes the order of questions in the output
  - Useful for creating multiple quiz versions

- **‚òëÔ∏è Randomize answer positions** (default: enabled)
  - Shuffles the position of the correct answer for each question
  - Prevents answer pattern memorization

- **‚è±Ô∏è Default time limit** (default: 20 seconds)
  - Applied to questions that don't have a time limit in the CSV
  - Valid range: 5-240 seconds

### Step 5: Generate Kahoot Quiz

1. Configure your shuffling and time limit preferences
2. Click the **"Generate Kahoot Quiz"** button
3. The Excel file will automatically download

The file will be named `kahoot-quiz-from-csv.xlsx`.

---

## Understanding Your Output

### What's in the Excel File?

The generated Excel file contains:

- Question text for each quiz question
- 4 answer choices per question (labeled Answer 1, Answer 2, Answer 3, Answer 4)

## Tips & Best Practices

### Writing Effective Topics

‚úÖ **DO:**

- Be specific: "French Revolution causes and outcomes"
- Include context: "State capitals of the United States"
- Mention difficulty: "Advanced calculus - derivatives"

‚ùå **DON'T:**

- Be too vague: "History"
- Use single words: "Math"
- Mix unrelated topics: "Science and geography and history"

### Using CSV Upload Effectively

1. **Prepare your CSV carefully**
   - Double-check spelling and capitalization in "Correct Answer" column
   - Remove extra spaces or special characters
   - Test with a small file (5-10 questions) first

2. **Use the preview feature**
   - Always review the preview before generating
   - Fix any validation errors shown in red
   - Verify question order and content

3. **Leverage shuffling options**
   - Enable "Shuffle question order" to create multiple quiz versions
   - Enable "Randomize answer positions" to prevent pattern memorization
   - Disable shuffling if you want questions in a specific order

4. **Set appropriate time limits**
   - Reading questions: 15-20 seconds
   - Math problems: 30-45 seconds
   - Complex analysis: 45-60 seconds
   - Adjust per-question in CSV for more control

### Question Design Best Practices

1. **Keep questions clear and concise**
   - Avoid overly complex sentence structures
   - Use simple, direct language
   - Aim for questions under 100 characters when possible

2. **Make distractors plausible**
   - Incorrect answers should be believable
   - Avoid obviously wrong choices
   - Use common misconceptions as incorrect answers

3. **Vary difficulty levels**
   - Mix easy, medium, and hard questions (70% medium, 20% easy, 10% hard)
   - Build confidence with easier questions first
   - End with challenging questions to maintain engagement

4. **Test one concept per question**
   - Don't combine multiple topics in one question
   - Keep focus narrow and specific

### Optimizing Question Count

- **Short attention spans?** Use 5-10 questions
- **Comprehensive testing?** Use 15-20 questions
- **Regular practice?** Use 10-12 questions
- **Competition/game?** Use 8-10 questions (keeps energy high)

## Troubleshooting

### AI Generation Issues

#### Issue: "Failed to generate quiz"

**Possible causes:**

- No internet connection
- AI service is temporarily unavailable
- Invalid topic or parameters

**Solutions:**

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try again in a few moments
3. Try a different, more specific topic
4. Reduce the number of questions

#### Issue: Questions not relevant to topic

**Possible causes:**

- Topic too vague
- AI misunderstood the context

**Solutions:**

- Regenerate with a more specific topic description
- Add more keywords to clarify intent
- Try rephrasing the topic

#### Issue: Duplicate questions

**Solutions:**

- Regenerate the quiz (AI generates new questions each time)
- Edit questions directly in Excel before uploading
- Modify questions after importing to Kahoot

### CSV Upload Issues

#### Issue: "File must be a CSV file with .csv extension"

**Solution:** Ensure your file is saved as `.csv` format, not `.xlsx` or other formats.

#### Issue: "File size exceeds maximum allowed size of 5 MB"

**Solution:** Reduce the number of questions or remove unnecessary columns from your CSV file.

#### Issue: "Correct answer must exactly match one of the four options"

**Cause:** The text in the "Correct Answer" column doesn't exactly match any of the four options.

**Solutions:**

1. Check for spelling errors
2. Verify capitalization matches exactly (case-sensitive)
3. Remove extra spaces before or after the answer text
4. Ensure you're using the exact same text

**Example:**

```csv
‚ùå Wrong: "Paris" vs "paris" (case mismatch)
‚ùå Wrong: "Paris" vs " Paris" (extra space)
‚úÖ Correct: "Paris" matches "Paris" exactly
```

#### Issue: "Question column not found" or "Option X column not found"

**Solution:** Ensure your CSV has all required columns. The application accepts various column names (case-insensitive):

- Question: "Question", "q", "question_text"
- Options: "Option 1", "option1", "answer 1", "choice 1", "a"
- Correct Answer: "Correct Answer", "correct", "answer", "solution"

#### Issue: "Maximum 100 questions allowed"

**Solution:** Split your quiz into multiple CSV files, each with 100 or fewer questions.

### General Issues

#### Issue: Download doesn't start

**Possible causes:**

- Browser blocking downloads
- Application not running

**Solutions:**

- Check browser download settings
- Look for download notification in browser

#### Issue: Downloaded file won't open

**Possible causes:**

- File download was interrupted
- Excel/spreadsheet software not installed

**Solutions:**

1. Try downloading the file again
2. Ensure you have Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or compatible software
3. Right-click the file and choose "Open with" to select your spreadsheet application

#### Issue: Kahoot rejects the Excel file

**Possible causes:**

- File format incompatibility
- Questions don't meet Kahoot's requirements

**Solutions:**

1. Download a fresh copy of the quiz file
2. Verify the file is in `.xlsx` format
3. Check that questions have exactly 4 answer choices
4. Ensure each question has exactly one correct answer
5. Open the file in Excel/Sheets to verify it looks correct before uploading
