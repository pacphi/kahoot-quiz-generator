**[SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER: AI Generation tab interface]**

### Step 1: Enter Your Quiz Topic

In the **Quiz Topic** field, provide a clear description or essential keywords for your quiz. The AI will use this to generate relevant questions.

- Include key concepts you want covered
- Use descriptive phrases rather than single words
- Mention the difficulty level if needed (e.g., "Introduction to Python for beginners")

### Step 2: Choose Number of Questions

Select how many questions you want (between 1 and 20).

**Recommended question counts:**
- **Quick review**: 5-10 questions
- **Standard quiz**: 10-15 questions
- **Comprehensive assessment**: 15-20 questions

### Step 3: Generate Your Quiz

Click the **Generate Quiz** button. The application will:
1. Send your topic to the AI
2. Generate unique questions with 4 multiple-choice answers each
3. Create an Excel file formatted for Kahoot

- **Option 4** (or "option4", "answer 4", "choice 4", "d") - Fourth answer choice
- **Correct Answer** (or "correct", "answer", "solution") - The text of the correct answer (must exactly match one of the four options)

**Optional Column:**
- **Time Limit** (or "time", "seconds", "duration") - Time limit in seconds (5-240). If not provided, defaults to 20 seconds.
